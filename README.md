# Mediocrity Spinner

A simple javascript website that has a randomised spinning wheel to randomly select a player. Built for a custom game of Monopoly I created in my spare time.

## To Do

- Create main spinner
- Add animations to spinner
- Allow users to add or remove players to the spinner
- Option to exclude a player from a spin
